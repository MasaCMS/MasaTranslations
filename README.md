# Masa Translations

This plugin manages translations between multiple [Mura CMS](http://www.getmura.com) sites and locales.

As of version 3.0, this plugin includes the ability to export a site and translate it externally, then import the content into a second site. This can be done multiple times (allowing changes and new content to be translated externally as well).
